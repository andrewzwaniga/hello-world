# #### Problem 5: Fitting a Gaussian template 
# 
# Here we show a program that generates random Gaussian noise on a finite interval and fits a one-parameter template Gaussian to different segments of the data. The single parameter to be fitted is the amplitude. 
# 
# Let $n_{d}$ be the number of entries in the data vector $\mathbf{d}$ and $n_{p}$ be the number of entries in the model vector $\mathbf{m}$. In this example, $n_{p} = 1$ so $\mathbf{m}=m$ is a scalar. $\mathbf{d}$ is $n_{d}\times1$ and the template matrix $A$ is $1\times n_{d}$. The noise matrix $N$ is $n_{d}\times n_{d}$. The least-squares maximum likelihood solution for $m$ is 
# 
# $\begin{equation} m = \frac{A^{\text{T}}N^{-1}\mathbf{d}}{A^{\text{T}}N^{-1}A}~~~~~~(1) \end{equation}$
# 
# The variance on $m$ is 
# 
# $ \begin{equation} \text{Var}[m] = (\frac{A^{\text{T}}N^{-1}}{A^{\text{T}}N^{-1}A})^{2}\text{Var}[\mathbf{d}] \end{equation}$

## Define the data window 

k = 0
k_max = 100

amps = numpy.zeros(k_max)
errs = numpy.zeros(k_max)

while k < k_max: 
    lower_bound = -5  # lower bound of data window 
    upper_bound = 5   # upper bound of data window 
    dx          = 0.01  # discretization of interval into bins of width 'delta'
    x           = numpy.arange(lower_bound, upper_bound, dx) # construct the x-axis 
    measure     = len(x) # length of the data window 

    ## Noise 

    noise = 0.5
    N_inv = 1/noise**2 # stationary noise: N_inv is the same for all data points 

    ## Define the injected function

    mu         = 0
    sigma      = 0.3
    amp_truth  = 2.0 # the true amplitude - code will attempt to fit this in a background of noise
    template   = numpy.exp(-0.5*(x-mu)**2/sigma**2) 

    ## Define the simulated data 

    # The data is a vector of length equal to to the interval's measure 
    # Note: numpy.random.randn(X) creates an array of shape [X_1, ..., X_n] 
    #       with each X_i being pulled from a standard normal distribution 

    data = amp_truth*template + numpy.random.randn(measure)*noise 

    ## Extraction of the injected function

    S2Nratio    = numpy.zeros(measure) # initialize with zeroes; signal-to-noise ratio
    A_LLS       = numpy.zeros(measure) # initialize with zeroes; this will be a vector of m's from equation (1) 
                                # at various positions in the data window  
    
    N_inv_d          = N_inv*data  # this is N^{-1}*d 
    A_T_N_inv_A      = numpy.dot(template, N_inv*template) # this is A^{T}*N^{-1}*A
    sqrt_A_T_N_inv_A = numpy.sqrt(A_T_N_inv_A)
    # Calculate the LLS maximum-likelihood amplitude at each location in the data window 

    for i in range(measure):
        template     = numpy.exp(-0.5*(x-x[i])**2/sigma**2) # for each i this is a scalar, so we get a vector 
        A_T_N_inv_d  = numpy.dot(template, N_inv_d) # numerator in eq (1)
        A_LLS[i]     = A_T_N_inv_d/A_T_N_inv_A      # this is the value of m at points in the data window, from eq (1)
        S2Nratio[i]  = A_T_N_inv_d/sqrt_A_T_N_inv_A  # signal-to-noise ratio 

    #plt.clf()
    #plt.plot(x, data)
    #plt.title("Raw Data")
    #plt.show()

    #plt.clf()
    #plt.plot(x, A_LLS)
    #plt.title("LLS fitted amplitudes to raw data")
    #plt.show()

    #print("The amplitude of trial " + str(k) + " is " + str(numpy.max(A_LLS)))
    
    amps[k] = numpy.max(A_LLS)
    errs[k] = 1/numpy.std(data)**2
    
    k += 1
    
numerator = 0; 
denominator = 0; 
    
for t in range(k_max):
    numerator += errs[t]*amps[t]
    denominator += amps[t]
    
weighted_average = numerator/denominator 

print("Weighted average of amplitudes: " + str(weighted_average))
    
print("The average amplitude of " + str(k_max) + " trials is " + str(numpy.mean(amps)) + ".")
print("The standard deviation of the " + str(k_max) + " trials is " + str(numpy.std(amps))+".")


# After running the program 100 times to produce 100 different data sets with the same injected Gaussian signal and random Gaussian noise at each data point, we can see that the average fitted amplitude is biased low because the noise plus the template Gaussian would give an amplitude of 2.0 + 0.5 = 2.5.
